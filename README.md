## What is Vue JS?

- For JS (JavaScript)
- JS Framework for building complex reactive front ends
- Reactive just means "is able to respond to user input"
- Web frontends: what the user sees, the HTML/CSS/JS running in the user's browser
- Vue is for the browser side JS
  - Vue can be paired with something such as Nuxt to implement server side rendering (SSR)

### What is a JS Framework?

- A third-party library that provides utility functions and a set of rules and clear guidance on how to build your JS application

## Why use Vue JS?

- Provides a more mobile app/desktop app experience in the web
- No visible requests to the server required and no need to wait for a new HTML page as a response
- Avoids re-inventing the wheel
- Helps when working with a team, as there are good maintained docs so that everyone knows the structure and code philosophy or ruleset of the codebase
- Helps avoid suboptimal code, errors, bugs, or security issues
- Lets the developers focus more on actually implementing business logic
- Solves some of the headaches and difficulties that you run into when dealing with vanilla js
